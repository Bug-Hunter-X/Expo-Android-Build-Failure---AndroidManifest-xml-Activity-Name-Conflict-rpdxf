This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android app and involves the AndroidManifest.xml file.  Specifically, the issue arises when there's a mismatch or conflict in the `android:name` attribute within the `<activity>` tag, particularly when dealing with multiple activities or React Navigation configurations.  The error message itself might not be very descriptive, making it difficult to pinpoint the exact cause.  The error can manifest as a build failure during the Android build process, preventing the app from packaging correctly.
