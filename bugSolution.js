The solution lies in carefully examining the `AndroidManifest.xml` file generated by Expo.  The exact problem will vary, but common scenarios include:

1. **Duplicate Activity Names:** Check for duplicate `android:name` attributes within the `<activity>` tags.  Ensure each activity has a unique name.  If you're using React Navigation or similar, make sure its configuration isn't creating conflicting activity names.

2. **Incorrect Activity Names:** Verify that the activity names are correctly specified according to your application's structure. Incorrect names, like typos or inconsistencies between your code and manifest, can trigger the error.

3. **External Library Conflicts:**  If you're using third-party libraries, they might also add activities to the manifest. Conflicts can arise if these libraries use the same activity names as your app or other libraries.  Check for version conflicts or try temporarily disabling libraries to isolate the source.

**Example of a Problem (Illustrative):**

```xml
<activity android:name="com.example.myapp.MainActivity">
</activity>
<activity android:name="com.example.myapp.MainActivity">  <!--Duplicate--!>
</activity>
```

**Debugging Steps:**

1. Carefully examine the complete error message from the Expo build process.  Even though it might be unhelpful, any part of the message might hint at the faulty activity.
2. If you use React Navigation or other navigation libraries, review their configuration. Ensure they are correctly set up to avoid naming conflicts.
3. Clean and rebuild the project to rule out caching issues.
4. If all else fails, consider creating a minimal reproducible example to isolate the issue.
